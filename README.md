## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS Flexbox and Grids were two things I had already down in my head but learned very quickly that there are more things I had figure out to master. Just reading through these two links: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/ and https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/ gave me much understanding in things I just do trial and error on. Grid area is the concept that was just introduced to me in this exercise and that was my favorite concept to have figured out and would definitely be using it in the future.

### Continued development

For future developments, learning more about interactions and responsive designs are still very much on the table as I follow the Frontend Mentor Path.

For updates on previous entries, font and text concepts were learned butnot applied in this challenge, will do so on the next. HTML tags are simmed through one by one and and as they are encountered. For media queries, there will be need for future lessons in this challenge path.
